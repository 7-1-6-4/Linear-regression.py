This model can help underdeveloped countries in several ways like:
Proactive Accident Prevention: The model helps predict accident severity under different conditions, allowing governments to take preventive measures (e.g., reducing speed limits in bad weather).
Data-Driven Decisions: Underdeveloped countries can use the model to make informed decisions about infrastructure improvements and road safety regulations.
Cost-Effective: Simple models like linear regression are cost-effective to implement, even with limited computational resources.
